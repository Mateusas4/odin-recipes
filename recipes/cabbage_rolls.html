        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Cabbage rolls are a classic Eastern European dish made from tender cabbage leaves filled with a savory mixture of ground meat and rice. They are simmered in a rich tomato sauce until perfectly cooked, making for a comforting and flavorful meal.</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul><li>1 large head of cabbage</li>
            <li>1 pound ground beef (or a mixture of beef and pork)</li>
            <li>1 cup cooked rice</li>
            <li>1 large onion, finely chopped</li>
            <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
            <li>1 large egg</li>
            <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
            <li>1 can (14.5 ounces) tomato sauce</li>
            <li>1 can (14.5 ounces) diced tomatoes</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon vegetable oil</li>
            <li>1/2 cup sour cream (optional)</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon sugar (optional)</li></ul>
            <h3>Steps</h3>
            <ol><li><strong>Prepare the Cabbage:</strong> Bring a large pot of water to a boil. Carefully remove the core from the cabbage and place the head into the boiling water. Cook for about 5-7 minutes, or until the leaves are soft and pliable. Remove from water and set aside to cool.</li>
                <li><strong>Prepare the Filling:</strong> In a large bowl, combine the ground meat, cooked rice, chopped onion, minced garlic, egg, salt, and pepper. Mix well until all ingredients are fully incorporated.</li>
                <li><strong>Assemble the Rolls:</strong> Gently separate the cabbage leaves. Place a small amount of the meat mixture onto each leaf, fold in the sides, and roll up tightly.</li>
                <li><strong>Cook the Golubtsy:</strong> In a large pot or Dutch oven, heat the vegetable oil over medium heat. Place the cabbage rolls seam-side down in the pot. Pour the tomato sauce and diced tomatoes over the rolls. Add sugar to the sauce if desired. Cover and simmer for 1 to 1.5 hours, or until the rolls are fully cooked.</li></ol>
