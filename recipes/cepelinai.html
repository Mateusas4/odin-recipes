                <h4>2. Prepare the Dough:</h4>

                <li>Place the grated potatoes into a cheesecloth or clean kitchen towel and squeeze out as much moisture as possible.</li>
                <li>In a large bowl, combine the grated potatoes, egg, flour, and salt. Mix well to form a dough.</li>
                <h4>3. Assemble the Cepelinai:</h4>
                <li>Take a portion of the potato dough and flatten it in the palm of your hand.</li>
                <li>Place a spoonful of the pork filling in the center of the dough.</li>
                <li>Carefully fold the dough around the filling and seal it, shaping it into an oval dumpling. Make sure the edges are well-sealed.</li>
                <h4>4. Cook the Cepelinai:</h4>
                <li>Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil.</li>
                <li>Carefully drop the dumplings into the boiling water.</li>
                <li>Reduce the heat and simmer the dumplings for about 30-40 minutes, or until they are cooked through and float to the surface.</li>
                <li>Remove the dumplings with a slotted spoon and let them drain.</li>
                <h4>5. Prepare the Sauce (Optional):</h4>
